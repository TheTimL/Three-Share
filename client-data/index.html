			<h3>Welcome to <strong>WBO</strong>!</h3>
			<p>
				WBO is a
				<a href="https://github.com/lovasoa/whitebophir" title="Free as in free speech, not free beer">free</a>
				online collaborative whiteboard that allows many users to draw
				simultaneously on a large
				virtual board.
				The board is updated in real time for all connected users, and its state is always persisted.
				It can be used for many different purposes, including art, entertainment, design and teaching.
			</p>
			<p>
				To collaborate on a drawing in real time with someone, just send them its URL.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>
				The <strong>anonymous board</strong> is accessible to everyone.
				It is a happily disorganized mess where you can meet with strangers and draw together.
				Everything there is ephemeral.

		<div>
			<p>You can also create a private board, that will be accessible only to those who know its name:</p>
			<form action="boards" method="GET">
				<input type="text" id="board" name="board" placeholder="Name of the board..." />
				<input type="submit" value="Go">
			</form>
